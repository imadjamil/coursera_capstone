# Introduction
>> Buisness problem description

Traffic accident is a wolrdwide major public health concern. In 2017, 115 deaths per million inhabitants were caused by raod accident in the USA. Currently, road crashes are the leading cause of death in the USA. 

One of the most important steps in managing traffic is estimating the severity of an accident. The latter provides critical information for emergency responders to evaluate the gravity level of each situation. Severity analysis helps also in estimating the potential impact of accidents and implementing efficient accident management and avoidance procedures. Furthermore, the accdident severity analysis helps in better managing traffic congestion and minimizing the delay caused by an accident. Finally and most importantly, severity analysis helps reducing the number of traffic accidents and their impact on public health.

This work aims at deriving a machine learning model to predict the severity of a car accident in terms of the impact on traffic delay. This will help authorities to implement efficient procedures to minimise the impact of road accidents. 

# Data
The dataset used in this work is a countrywide car accident dataset that covers 49 states of the USA. The data is collected between February 2016 and June 2020. The collection was done by a variety of entities such as the US and state departments of transportation, law enforcement agencies, traffic cameras, and traffic sensors. The dataset includes about 3.5 million entries.

The dataset consists of 48 features. Each record has an unique identifier. A column indicates the source entiry that collected the data record. The start time and end time of the accident are recorded as well as the starting and ending points latitude and latitude. These information clearly help predicting the traffic delay that could be caused by the accident. For instance, an accident that occurs on a main highway in the rush hour is 
kely to result in a longer traffic delay than an accident that occurs in the countryside at midnight.

This work uses the afformentioned dataset to predict the severity of the impact of an accident in terms of traffic delay.
